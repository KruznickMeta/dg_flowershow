title: GRINDE Mind Mapping Framework
---
This video, "The Ultimate Guide to The Perfect Mindmap (6-Step Checklist)" by Justin Sung, outlines a six-step framework called GRINDE for creating effective mind maps that lead to deep understanding, strong memory, and the ability to apply knowledge effectively.

## Summary
The video emphasizes that a perfect mind map is less about the map itself and more about the **process used to create it**, which forces the brain to engage in high-efficiency encoding, turning information into memory.
## Framework
Here are the key points of the GRINDE framework:

- **G - Grouping:** This involves arranging related ideas together. The crucial aspect is **thinking about _how_ to group information**, as there are multiple ways, and the most obvious way is not always the best for your memory. The process of grouping promotes stronger memory and deeper understanding, and the organized information is easier to retain and access later. This relates to concepts like chunking, scaffolding, and creating mental models or information schemas.
- **R - Relational:** This step focuses on **thinking about and expressing how ideas are related to each other** on the mind map. There are different levels of relationships, and it's important to find a good balance, avoiding too few or too many relationships. You need to consciously decide which relationships are important to include. The types of relationships emphasized can influence the groups formed.
- **I - Interconnected:** Once groups and relationships are established, this step involves **ensuring that the groups themselves are related and connected to each other** to create an overall structure and a "big picture" understanding of the topic. Failing to do this can result in "islands" of isolated understanding, restricting the ability to apply information fluidly. Properly interconnected mind maps help form a "knowledge schema" in the brain.
- **N - Nonverbal:** This step encourages expressing ideas **without relying heavily on words**. Reducing unnecessary words forces synthesis and summarization, engaging the "generation effect" of learning. Using lines, arrows, and spatial arrangement can represent ideas. Incorporating simple, sometimes abstract images ("memory landmarks") can make the information more memorable during review.
- **D - Directional:** A perfect mind map should have **directionality or flow**, using arrows to show how ideas interact. This forces an examination of the nature of relationships and groups and makes the mind map clearer and more organized, aiding retention.
- **E - Emphasized:** This final step involves **making deliberate judgments about which relationships, groups, and combinations are the most important** for the topic and visually representing this on the mind map, creating the "backbone" of the mind map. This higher-order thinking refines and consolidates knowledge, making it more accurate, deeper, and stickier in memory. This recursive process of adjusting the mind map structure is a natural part of deep learning.
 

> [!warning] AI Usage
> The video also discusses the use of **AI in mind mapping**. It suggests that AI can be harmful if it makes organizing information cognitively easier or bypasses the need for active independent judgments. However, AI can be helpful for saving time in collecting or summarizing information for you to then process, compare, and make judgments on, or for tasks similar to quick information verification.
