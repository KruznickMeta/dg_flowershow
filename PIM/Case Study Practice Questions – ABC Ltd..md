### Case Study Practice Questionsâ€“ABC Ltd.

#### **Question 1**
ABCâ€™s new HR policies include monitoring employee emails without prior communication or consent. From the standpoint of employee trust and organizational integrity, what potential concerns arise from this approach? How should the leadership balance company interests with employee expectations in such cases?
#### **Question 2**
The production structure at ABC involves multiple executives giving directions to the same set of supervisors, and an unusually large number of employees reporting to a single supervisor. What coordination or authority-related challenges might this create, and how can the company address them to improve day-to-day operations?
#### **Question 3**
Although ABC has held strategic planning meetings, their key outcomes are limited to senior management and not cascaded throughout the organization. How might this approach affect the alignment of departmental actions with long-term goals? What changes would improve clarity and direction for the wider workforce?
#### **Question 4**
ABCâ€™s brand name failed to resonate in its new target market, and internal operations have not seen recent upgrades in systems or processes. Considering this, what steps can ABC take to respond more creatively to shifting customer needs and emerging external challenges?
#### **Question 5**
ABC has faced complaints over declining product quality and poor customer aftercare, including warranty issues. How can ABC involve its employees in improving these outcomes, and what continuous practices might help prevent such issues from recurring?
