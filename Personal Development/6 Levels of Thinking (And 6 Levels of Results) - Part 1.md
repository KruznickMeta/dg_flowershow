# 6 Levels of Thinking (And 6 Levels of Results) - Part 1
## Highlights
- These levels (and the results they lead to) are:
  1. Remember → **Regurgitate**
  2. Understand → **Explain**
  3. Apply → **Simple problem solving**
  4. Analyse → **Comparison**
  5. Evaluate → **Prioritise**
  6. Create → **Hypothesise**
  Unfortunately, most people are stuck at the first few levels and the reason they struggle to get top results is that they're thinking at the wrong level. Now, if this looks familiar to you, that's because it's described in a framework called **Bloom's revised taxonomy**.
  *(A riveting name, I know…)*
